# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline that leads to incorrect results when grouping and sorting documents. The pipeline is designed to count the occurrences of a specific field and sort the results in descending order, but it produces unexpected results due to an error in the grouping or sorting logic.

## Bug Description
The aggregation pipeline uses the `$group` operator to group documents by a specific field and the `$sum` operator to count the number of documents in each group. The `$sort` operator is then used to sort the results in descending order based on the count. However, the pipeline produces incorrect counts and sorting order.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the aggregation pipeline stages and ensuring that the operators are used correctly and in the right sequence to produce the desired result. This might involve correcting the logic in the `$group` stage, or making the aggregation pipeline stages more specific to achieve the desired outcome. The corrected pipeline is included in the repository for comparison and understanding.
